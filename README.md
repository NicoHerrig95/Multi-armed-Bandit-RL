# Multi-arm bandit environment and algorithms
> This repository contains a python class for simulating the multi-arm bandit problem with implementations of the most common algorithms for action-selection, action value methods and options for process stationarity (i.e., adversarial bandits).
> The scope of this project is to provide a comprehensive but easy-to-use environment for stochastic analysis of the problem.
